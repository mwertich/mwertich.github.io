Personal Info
======
Hi, I am Martin Wertich, a second-year MSc student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. 

My interests lie in the field of Theoretical Machine Learning with the focus on the mathematical intuition behind it. I am particularly interested in the mathematics of Deep Learning,  Learning Theory, and Optimization Theory. My goal is to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning after completing my Master's degree, to make a small contribution to understanding the inner workings of advanced ML methods, even for non-mathematicians. 

I worked as a Research Assistant at the ETH AI Center until September 2025, where I and my student colleagues developed an RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) pipeline for LLMs (Large Language Models) using Active Learning.

Research Interests
------
The field of Machine Learning fascinates me the most in Computer Science, as it is one of the few CS fields that combines both mathematical rigor and practical relevance for the future. The advancement of new technologies, particularly in Generative Modelling, surpasses our understanding by a continuously increasing margin, and we need to catch up with the forefront of Machine Learning Research.

I find it particularly exciting to puzzle over mathematical proofs, even if it is often initially frustrating and takes a tremendous amount of time, because every solved or unsolved proof advances me and prepares me for the next potentially more difficult one.
I am particularly impressed by the CS research groups at ETH, where doctoral students support their research with  


Short Biography
------

I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, where I quickly realized that the mathematical subjects, particularly machine learning and mathematical modeling, best matched my interests, in contrast to the more applied subjects. In my bachelor's thesis, I analyzed the mathematics of Attention Layers in Transformer models.

Fortunately, I had the opportunity to join ETH as a Master's student, ranked as the best university in Continental Europe for Computer Science. ETH excels in mathematics and equips its students with a solid foundation to make significant advances in the field. 

I enjoy teaching students, which I was able to do as a teaching assistant in Stochastics and Machine Learning (ETH Master's).

Nonetheless, I also worked outside the academic bubble during my bachelor's degree. I started as an ML engineer, working as a Werkstudent at Schott in Mainz, where I primarily investigated Explainable AI for large time-series data streams. After that, I worked as an intern at Envision Entertainment in Ingelheim as a software developer on the strategy computer game "Pioneers of Pagonia", which was already released in Early Access, but is yet to be fully released.

Hobbies & Interests
------

I love the Swiss Alps, which, if ETH permits time, I like to explore all over the country. I go hiking and climbing in the summer, while skiing and cross-country skiing during winter. 
Moreover, I am a fan of board and card games and enjoy playing them to socialize during a game night with my ETH colleagues.
